# Building a Static API with Middleman

This repository is to support both [a written article](https://cobwwweb.com/building-static-api-middleman) and [a video tutorial](https://youtu.be/yT20EwSVo6A) on [how to build a _static API_](https://cobwwweb.com/how-to-build-static-api) using the [Middleman static site generator](https://middlemanapp.com/).

## Getting Started

Assume you're already somewhat familiar with Middleman, to get started with this code, first clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/seancdavis/middleman-static-api.git

And then boot up the development server:

    $ bundle exec middleman

## Help!

If you find a bug or have questions about the repo, I'd prefer if you create an issue in this repository. However, I can't get to every request. If I'm being unresponsive, you can also try me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/seancdavis29).
